# Contributing to the Manual

This document is based on the old manual for OpenHoldem 2.0, lots of
former Wiki-entries and lots of forum-posts at
<http://www.maxinmontreal.com/forums/>. Many people contributed to it,
but as you can see this manual is neither complete nor perfect. Lets
blame the people who put it together for everything ;-)

If you have some corrections or additions and want to help us to improve
this manual then feel welcome to get in contact with the development
team.

## Technical reference for developers

- the sources of this manual can be checked out from
  <https://github.com/OpenHoldem/openholdembot/tree/master/Documentation>

- to edit the sources we use L-.1667em.25emY-.125emX version 2.2.4.
  L-.1667em.25emY-.125emX is a graphical frontent for the mathematical
  type-setting-system LaTeX, but don’t get frightened: it is simply a
  what-you-*mean*-is-what-you-get editor. L-.1667em.25emY-.125emX is
  available at: <a href="www.lyx.org/" class="uri">www.lyx.org/</a>.

- L-.1667em.25emY-.125emX usually creates PDF, PS or DVI-files. However
  we export everything to HTML (File -\> Export -\> HTML).

- Finally we use MicroSofts HTML-help-workshop to create a “compiled
  HTML” help-file (\*.CHM). The HTML-help-workshop is available here:
